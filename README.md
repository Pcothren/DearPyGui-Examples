## Contribute
Requirements for new examples:
- Be complete. It's okay to wait. Falling behind in commits to this repository is easily resolved as every example is an isolated app.
- Breif explination of features that are highlighted in the example. Preferably use text or treenode(bullet) widgets.
- Self contained, atleast as much as possible. the less resource files the better. 
- Focus on the features being showcased. Only be as complex as necessary, overly complex examples may distract from the goal. (Ex. don't create a huge app if you only intend to showcase a button.)
